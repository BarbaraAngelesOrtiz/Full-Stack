# Exercises 1.1.-1.2.

One very functional file structure for the submission repository is as follows:

  part1
      courseinfo
      unicafe
      anecdotes

For each part of the course, there is a directory, which further branches into directories containing a series of exercises, like "unicafe" for part 1.

1.1 - 1.5: courseinfo

1.6 - 1.11: unicafe

1.12 - 1.14: anecdotes
